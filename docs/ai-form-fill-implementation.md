# AI Form Fill Feature Implementation

## Overview

This feature uses Anthropic's Claude API to analyze wine label images and automatically extract information to pre-fill the wine form fields. This saves users time and reduces manual data entry.

## Implementation Details

### Backend

1. Created a new endpoint `/api/wines/analyze-label` that accepts wine label images
2. Implemented an Anthropic API client in `wine-cellar.ai.anthropic` namespace
3. Added a handler function `analyze-wine-label` to process the request

### Frontend

1. Added a new API function `analyze-wine-label` to call the backend endpoint
2. Added an "Analyze Label" button to the wine form
3. Implemented loading state during analysis
4. Added logic to update the form fields with the extracted information

## Configuration

See [environment-variables.md](environment-variables.md) for configuration details.

## Usage

1. Upload a wine label image (front and optionally back)
2. Click the "Analyze Label" button
3. Wait for the analysis to complete
4. Review and edit the extracted information as needed
5. Submit the form to create the wine entry

## Next Steps

1. Test the feature with various wine labels
2. Refine the prompt to improve extraction accuracy
3. Add error handling for cases where the API fails or returns unexpected data
4. Consider adding a feature to save the prompt and response for debugging
5. Add support for different languages on wine labels

## Technical Considerations

- The feature uses a backend proxy to avoid CORS issues and keep the API key secure
- Images are encoded as base64 strings for transmission
- The prompt is designed to extract specific wine details in JSON format
- The response is parsed and mapped to the form fields

## Dependencies

- Anthropic Claude API (requires an API key)
