### Reasoning

You're absolutely right about the complexities of wine taxonomy. The classifications vary significantly by country, and there's conceptual overlap between quality tiers and classifications. Let me analyze the current situation:

### Current Data Structure Analysis

Your current approach is pragmatic - using a uniform data structure with flexible interpretation of fields:

1. **AOC (Appellation)**: Used universally for the specific geographic wine region
2. **Classification**: Used for:
   - French quality tiers (Premier Cru Classé, Grand Cru)
   - Italian/Spanish/other regulatory designations (DOCG, DOC, DO)
   - US/Australia/other regional designation systems (AVA, GI)
3. **Levels**: Used for aging/quality designations within regulatory systems (Riserva, Gran Selezione, Crianza)

### Wine Classification Complexity By Country

The different approaches each country takes:

1. **France**: Multiple tiered hierarchies with AOC/AOP as the base, then complex classification systems that vary by region:
   - Bordeaux: 1855 Classification (Premiers Crus, etc.)
   - Burgundy: Grand Cru, Premier Cru vineyard designations
   - Beaujolais: Cru designations for specific villages

2. **Italy**: Two-level national system (DOCG > DOC > IGT) with aging-based quality tiers like Riserva

3. **Spain**: National designation system (DOCa/DO) with aging-based quality tiers (Crianza, Reserva, Gran Reserva)

4. **Germany**: Quality levels (Prädikatswein, etc.) with ripeness designations (Kabinett, Spätlese, etc.)

5. **United States**: Geographic designations (AVAs) without official quality tiers

### Ideal Data Model

If you were designing a more comprehensive wine taxonomy system, it might look like:

```clojure
{:country "France"
 :region "Bordeaux"
 :sub-region "Médoc"
 :appellation "Pauillac"
 :regulatory-system "AOC"
 :classification-system "1855 Classification"
 :quality-tier "Premier Cru Classé"
 :producer "Château Latour"}
```

Or for Italy:

```clojure
{:country "Italy"
 :region "Tuscany"
 :appellation "Chianti Classico"
 :regulatory-system "DOCG"
 :quality-tier "Gran Selezione"
 :aging-designation "Riserva"
 :producer "Castello di Ama"}
```

### Recommendation

For your purposes though, the current approach is a good balance of flexibility and structure. You can identify wines effectively, and since you're primarily focused on French and Italian wines, the system works well enough.

I think you can maintain the current structure for now. If you find specific limitations as you expand your app, you can always refine the model or add specific accommodations for certain countries.

### Response

# Wine Classification Complexities

You've hit on one of the fundamental challenges of the wine world! You're absolutely right - wine classification systems vary dramatically by country, with each having its own rich, complex, and sometimes contradictory approach:

## The Country Problem

- **France**: Uses AOC/AOP with region-specific hierarchies (1855 Bordeaux Classification, Burgundy's vineyard-specific Grand/Premier Cru system)
- **Italy**: Uses a national pyramid (DOCG > DOC > IGT) with aging-based quality designations
- **Spain**: Similar to Italy but with different terminology (DOCa/DO and aging tiers)
- **Germany**: Based primarily on ripeness and sweetness levels rather than geography
- **New World**: Often just geographic designations (AVA, GI) with fewer quality tiers

Your current approach is a practical compromise that works well for your needs. The dual use of `:classification` is actually quite sensible given the constraints.

## Pragmatic Approach

For a personal wine tracking app, perfect taxonomic accuracy is less important than practical usability. Your current structure allows you to:

1. Uniquely identify wine regions
2. Track quality levels that matter to collectors
3. Maintain a simple data structure

If you were building an academic wine database, you might need separate systems for each country. But for tracking your collection and tastings, this approach works well.

The data you've assembled provides an excellent foundation, especially for someone focusing on French and Italian wines. You can always refine it through the UI as you encounter edge cases.
