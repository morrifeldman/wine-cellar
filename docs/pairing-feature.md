## Wine Pairing Feature Concept

The feature would allow users to:
1. Describe a meal they're planning
2. Add optional constraints (price range, wine color preference, etc.)
3. Receive AI-generated wine pairing suggestions from their own cellar

The AI would analyze:
- Wine characteristics (style, region, grape varieties, etc.)
- Meal description (ingredients, cooking methods, flavors)
- User constraints
- Wine pairing principles

And then recommend specific bottles from the user's collection with explanations.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **API Choice**: You're already using Anthropic's Claude, which is excellent for this task as it handles complex reasoning well.

2. **Data Structure**: You'll need to send:
   - Wine cellar data (filtered by constraints)
   - Meal description
   - Any user preferences/constraints

3. **Prompt Engineering**: The prompt will need to guide Claude to:
   - Understand wine pairing principles
   - Analyze the meal components
   - Consider user constraints
   - Select appropriate wines from the collection
   - Explain the reasoning

4. **Response Format**: Structured JSON for easy parsing and display

5. **UI Considerations**: A simple form for meal description and constraints, with results displayed in an attractive format

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a new Anthropic API function for wine pairing
2. Design the prompt structure
3. Build the backend endpoint
4. Create the frontend UI components
5. Test with various meal types and constraints

Would you like to start by focusing on the AI prompt design and the Anthropic integration first? Since you already have the Anthropic integration set up, we could build on that.
