# Context for Claude

I am making a wine cellar tracking web app. It is a learning project. I'm good
with back end Clojure and am using Clojurescript for the front end. I currently
use Viveno, but I'm a bit frustrated with Viveno. Too many ads and difficult to
do the simple tracking that I want. I've made some good progress so far. Please
consider this context but don't jump right into the task till I focus you.
Sometimes I will want to have short conversations focused on tooling setup. I
use nvim. Please do not give an answer if you want more data -- I'd rather just
give you the data.

## Chat 2

During our session, we've made several significant improvements to your Wine Cellar app:

### 1. Data Layer Enhancements:
- Created a database view `wines-with-ratings` that efficiently includes the latest tasting note rating with each wine
- Successfully implemented the view using HoneySQL with proper syntax
- Updated the API function to use this view

### 2. Filtering and Sorting Features:
- Added comprehensive filtering capabilities (text search, country, region, style)
- Implemented sortable table headers with visual indicators
- Fixed sorting issues with null values, especially for ratings
- Split complex filtering logic into smaller, more maintainable functions

### 3. UI Structure Improvements:
- Refactored the wine-list component into smaller, focused components
- Created clear separation between table rows, table headers, and detail views
- Added latest rating column to the wine table

### 4. Material UI Integration Plan:
- Reviewed your setup with shadow-cljs and identified that you already have MUI v5 dependencies
- Selected `arttuka/reagent-material-ui` as the wrapper library for integrating MUI
- Demonstrated how to convert a basic component to use MUI styling
- Set up the implementation approach for responsive design

For your next steps, you'll be implementing Material UI components throughout your application to improve both aesthetics and mobile responsiveness, starting with adding the wrapper library to your dependencies and converting components one by one.

## Our Journey So Far

We've successfully addressed several key issues in your wine cellar application:

1. **Fixed Critical Reactivity Issue**
   - Changed regular Clojure atoms to Reagent atoms (`r/atom`)
   - Learned proper dereferencing patterns for Reagent components
   - Ensured UI reflects state changes correctly

2. **Solved Database Integration**
   - Fixed date conversion for tasting notes
   - Addressed PostgreSQL type compatibility issues
   - Implemented proper error handling

3. **Improved React Component Structure**
   - Fixed "key" prop warnings in list renderings
   - Applied proper Reagent metadata syntax (`^{:key id}`)
   - Ensured efficient component updates

## Potential Next Steps (in order of recommended priority)

### 1. Enhanced UI with Material UI

**Benefits**: Professional look and feel, consistent design system, pre-built components.

**Implementation**: Add [reagent-material-ui](https://github.com/arttuka/reagent-material-ui) to your project:
```clojure
[arttuka/reagent-material-ui "5.11.12-0"]
```

Start by replacing basic components with Material equivalents:
- Tables → MUI Tables with sorting
- Forms → MUI Form controls
- Buttons → MUI Buttons with icons

### 2. Wine List Sorting & Filtering

**Benefits**: Better usability for larger collections, faster information access.

**Implementation**:
- Add sort state to your app-state: `{:sort-by :producer, :sort-dir :asc}`
- Create sort controls above the wine table
- Implement a simple search filter for quick wine lookup

### 3. Enhanced Classification System

**Benefits**: Better organization, more detailed wine information.

**Implementation**:
- Expand classification schema with additional fields (region, grape varieties)
- Create a hierarchical classification system
- Add filtering by classification

### 4. Analytics & Visualizations

**Benefits**: Visual insights into your collection.

**Implementation**: 
- Add charts showing wine distribution by region, price range, etc.
- Implement [Oz](https://github.com/metasoarous/oz) or [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) for visualization
- Create a dashboard view

### 5. Responsive Design

**Benefits**: Mobile-friendly experience, use app anywhere in your cellar.

**Implementation**:
- Add responsive breakpoints
- Create specialized mobile view for wine details
- Optimize forms for touch interactions

## Technical Improvements

1. **Optimistic UI Updates**: Update UI before server confirms changes
2. **Error Recovery**: Better handling of API failures
3. **State Management**: Consider using re-frame for larger app scaling
