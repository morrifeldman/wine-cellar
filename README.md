# Context for Claude

I am making a wine cellar tracking web app. It is a learning project. I'm good
with back end Clojure and am using Clojurescript for the front end. I currently
use Viveno, but I'm a bit frustrated with Viveno. Too many ads and difficult to
do the simple tracking that I want. I've made some good progress so far. Please
consider this context but don't jump right into the task till I focus you.
Sometimes I will want to have short conversations focused on tooling setup. I
use nvim.

## Other notes

Use the Ansible playbook to setup postgresql.

`ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts playbooks/postgresql.yml`
