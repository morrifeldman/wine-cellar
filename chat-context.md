# Context for Claude

I am making a wine cellar tracking web app. It is a learning project. I'm good
with back end Clojure and am using Clojurescript for the front end. I currently
use Viveno, but I'm a bit frustrated with Viveno. Too many ads and difficult to
do the simple tracking that I want. I've made some good progress so far. Please
consider this context but don't jump right into the task till I focus you.
Sometimes I will want to have short conversations focused on tooling setup. I
use nvim. Please do not give an answer if you want more information or files -- I'd rather just give you the data.

# Chat Summary: UI Refinements and Feature Enhancements

## Key Issues Addressed

1. **Fixed Data Type Conversion**
   - Identified a bug where numeric fields (vintage, quantity) were being sent as strings to the backend
   - Updated form submission to properly convert all numeric fields:
   ```clojure
   (api/create-wine app-state
                    (-> new-wine
                        (update :price js/parseFloat)
                        (update :vintage #(js/parseInt % 10))
                        (update :quantity #(js/parseInt % 10))))
   ```

2. **Improved Data Refresh Logic**
   - Added automatic wine list refresh after adding tasting notes
   - Ensured latest ratings appear in the wine list immediately after returning from detail view
   - Updated "Back to List" button to fetch fresh data:
   ```clojure
   :onClick #(do
               (swap! app-state dissoc :selected-wine-id :tasting-notes)
               (swap! app-state assoc :new-tasting-note {})
               (api/fetch-wines app-state))
   ```

3. **Added "In Cellar" Filtering**
   - Implemented toggle to hide/show consumed wines (quantity = 0)
   - Added `show-out-of-stock?` flag to app-state
   - Updated filtering logic to respect this setting
   - Added toggle button with "In Cellar Only" / "All History" text options

4. **Added Wine Statistics Dashboard**
   - Created statistics overview showing:
     - Total wines (visible vs. total)
     - Total bottles in collection
     - Average rating across collection
     - Total collection value

5. **UI Button Consistency**
   - Removed inconsistent icons from buttons
   - Standardized on text-only buttons with consistent styling
   - Vertically stacked action buttons in the wine table
   - Used consistent color schemes (primary for view, error for delete)

## Implementation Approach

1. **Type-safety**: Applied consistent type conversion at submission time rather than relying solely on input change handlers

2. **State Management**: Used React-style state updates via `swap!` to modify the application state in response to user actions

3. **Filtering Logic**: Maintained separation of concerns with filter functions that work on the entire collection

4. **UI Layout**: Used Material UI Box and flexbox for layout control instead of raw CSS

5. **Terminology**: Chose user-friendly, personal terminology ("In Cellar" vs "In Stock") to match the personal nature of the app

These refinements collectively improve the application's robustness and usability while maintaining a clean, consistent interface for tracking your personal wine collection.

# Chat Summary: Wine Classifications Data

In this session, we worked on expanding and refining wine classification data for your application. Here's what we accomplished:

1. **Extended the data**: Starting with your initial French and Italian wine classifications, we added comprehensive entries for:
   - All major French wine regions (Bordeaux, Burgundy, Rhône, Loire, Alsace, Champagne, Beaujolais, Provence, Languedoc-Roussillon, Corsica, Jura, Savoie)
   - Additional countries (Spain, Germany, United States, Australia, Portugal, Argentina, Chile)

2. **Fixed structural issues**:
   - Removed duplicate entries
   - Ensured all entries were properly enclosed in vector brackets
   - Standardized the data format

3. **Addressed classification complexities**:
   - Discussed the challenge of using `:classification` for both French quality tiers (Premier Cru Classé) and regulatory designations in other countries (DOCG, AVA)
   - Acknowledged that different countries have fundamentally different wine classification systems
   - Decided that the current pragmatic approach works well for a personal wine tracking app

4. **Used official sources**: Referenced French government resources (INAO) for comprehensive AOC listings

5. **Final result**: Created a structured dataset with approximately 150 wine classifications covering all major wine-producing regions worldwide, with emphasis on French and Italian wines that align with your interests.

The data structure allows for adding new classifications through your UI as you encounter them, providing a solid foundation for your wine tracking application.

# Session Summary: Adding Wine Classification Management

## Problem Statement
We needed to enhance the wine cellar application to allow users to add new wine classifications directly from the UI. The goal was to let users create classifications while adding wines, improving the user experience by eliminating the need to add classifications separately.

## Solution Overview
We implemented a complete solution by:
1. Creating an API endpoint for adding classifications
2. Adding a handler function to process classification creation requests
3. Adding a form component to the UI for entering classification details
4. Implementing database constraints to prevent duplicate classifications
5. Adding logic to merge wine levels when adding to existing classifications

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes
1. **Database Constraints**: Implemented a `UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT` constraint to handle NULL values properly in the uniqueness check:
   ```clojure
   [[:constraint :wine_classifications_natural_key]
    :unique-nulls-not-distinct
    [:composite :country :region :aoc :communal_aoc
     :classification :vineyard]]
   ```

2. **API Handler**: Created a handler for processing classification creation requests:
   ```clojure
   (defn create-classification [request]
     (let [classification (-> request :parameters :body)
           classification-with-levels (update classification :levels vec)]
       (try
         (let [created-classification (db/create-classification classification-with-levels)]
           {:status 201
            :body created-classification})
         (catch Exception e
           (server-error e)))))
   ```

3. **API Route**: Added a route for creating classifications:
   ```clojure
   ["/api/classifications"
    {:post {:summary "Create a new wine classification"
            :parameters {:body classification-schema}
            :responses {201 {:body map?}
                        400 {:body map?}
                        500 {:body map?}}
            :handler handlers/create-classification}}]
   ```

### Frontend Changes
1. **API Function**: Added a function to call the classification creation endpoint:
   ```clojure
   (defn create-classification [app-state classification]
     (go
       (let [response (<! (http/post (str api-base-url "/api/classifications")
                                   (merge default-opts
                                          {:json-params classification})))]
         (if (:success response)
           (do
             (swap! app-state assoc 
                    :creating-classification? false
                    :new-classification nil)
             (fetch-classifications app-state))
           (swap! app-state assoc :error "Failed to create classification")))))
   ```

2. **UI Component**: Created a form for entering classification details:
   ```clojure
   (defn classification-form [app-state]
     (let [new-class (or (:new-classification @app-state) {})]
       [paper {:elevation 2 :sx {:p 3 :mb 3 :bgcolor "background.paper"}}
        [typography {:variant "h6" :component "h3" :sx {:mb 2}} "Add New Classification"]
        [grid {:container true :spacing 2}
         ;; Form fields 
         ;; ...
         ]]))
   ```

3. **Integration**: Added a button to toggle the classification form from within the wine creation form.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Optional Levels**: Made wine levels optional in classifications to accommodate regions without specific level designations.

2. **Region Structure**: Used actual wine regions (like Napa Valley) rather than political regions (like states) for more accurate wine data organization.

3. **Inline Form**: Integrated the classification form within the wine creation workflow rather than creating a separate page.

4. **Database Constraints**: Used PostgreSQL 15's `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` feature to properly handle uniqueness with NULL values.

5. **Level Merging**: Implemented logic to merge levels when adding to an existing classification rather than creating duplicates.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

1. **NULL Handling in Constraints**: Solved the issue of NULL values being treated as distinct in uniqueness constraints by using PostgreSQL 15's `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` feature.

2. **Form Toggle**: Implemented a clean UI pattern for showing/hiding the classification form when needed.

3. **Level vs. Levels**: Clarified the distinction between single wine levels (`level`) and classification level arrays (`levels`).

This implementation now allows users to seamlessly add new classifications while adding wines, improving the overall workflow of the application.

## Summary of Implemented Features

### 1. Quantity Adjustment
We've successfully implemented a clean, intuitive quantity control with:
- Compact up/down arrows instead of bulky +/- buttons
- Direct quantity updates through the backend API
- Proper disable state when quantity reaches zero
- Consistent display in both the wine table and detail views
- Clean alignment that puts the control on a single line with the label

### 2. Name/Producer Constraint
We've added validation to ensure either a wine name or producer is provided:
- Created a validation function that checks this constraint
- Added form validation that prevents submission if neither field is present
- Included helper text to communicate this requirement to users
- Simplified the UI by keeping it clean without overwhelming error states
- Server-side validation still in place for data integrity

These features improve your wine cellar app's usability while maintaining a clean, intuitive interface. The quantity adjustment in particular gives users a simple way to manage their inventory as they consume wines.

For your next features, you might consider implementing:
- Tasting window functionality
- Classification management
- Vivino import capabilities

## Chat 2

During our session, we've made several significant improvements to your Wine Cellar app:

### 1. Data Layer Enhancements:
- Created a database view `wines-with-ratings` that efficiently includes the latest tasting note rating with each wine
- Successfully implemented the view using HoneySQL with proper syntax
- Updated the API function to use this view

### 2. Filtering and Sorting Features:
- Added comprehensive filtering capabilities (text search, country, region, style)
- Implemented sortable table headers with visual indicators
- Fixed sorting issues with null values, especially for ratings
- Split complex filtering logic into smaller, more maintainable functions

### 3. UI Structure Improvements:
- Refactored the wine-list component into smaller, focused components
- Created clear separation between table rows, table headers, and detail views
- Added latest rating column to the wine table

### 4. Material UI Integration Plan:
- Reviewed your setup with shadow-cljs and identified that you already have MUI v5 dependencies
- Selected `arttuka/reagent-material-ui` as the wrapper library for integrating MUI
- Demonstrated how to convert a basic component to use MUI styling
- Set up the implementation approach for responsive design

For your next steps, you'll be implementing Material UI components throughout your application to improve both aesthetics and mobile responsiveness, starting with adding the wrapper library to your dependencies and converting components one by one.
